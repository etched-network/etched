# What is Etched?

Etched is a FOSS Bitcoin Layer 2 project. It allows users to deploy and interact with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) smart contracts by processing transactions directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. 

Etched is NOT a rollup, Etched is a EVM layer 2. Etched uses Bitcoin's POW for security, sequencing and data. Etched is trustless with no centralised part.
